_guarahooks_ is a open collection of custom react hooks with focus on performance, type-safety and reusability. It provides a wide range of hooks for common use cases.

## How does it work?

All the hooks created here are converted into JSON files that follows the [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) schema. With this, the hooks can be used in any project that uses the [Shadcn UI CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/cli). In essence, when you need a hook, you simply choose from the list of hooks and copy-and-paste into your projects by CLI or manually.

## Why use this collection?

By using this collection, you can:

- Reduce the amount of code you write
- Reduce the amount of time spent on writing hooks
- Reduce the amount of time spent on debugging hooks
