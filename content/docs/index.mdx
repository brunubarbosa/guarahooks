**GuaraHooks** is a collection of re-usable hooks that you can copy and paste into your web apps.

It features hooks and examples of how to use them. All geared towards building apps and websites.

## Philosophy

> I personally believe that hooks are one of the most powerful features of React. They allow you to create reusable logic that can be used in any component and are a great way to share code accross your app.

### The problem

Today, when you want a hook, you have to:

- Search the web for examples and try to implement it yourself
- Install and use a library

But this has it drawbacks:

- When trying to implement a hook, it costs you a lot of time depending on the complexity of the hook and your previous knowledge
- When you use a library, you have to deal with the possible drawbacks of the library, like the bundle size, the complexity of the code, the maintainability of the code, etc.

### The solution

This library aims to solve these problems with the following features:

- You can copy and paste the hooks into your apps, so you have full control over them
- The hooks are well documented and have examples of it's usage
- The hooks are all type-safe and optimized for performance

This library is heavily inspired by [https://ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [https://magicui.design](https://magicui.design).
