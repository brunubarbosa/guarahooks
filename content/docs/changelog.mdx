## June 2025 - UI Improvements

We've improved the interface of the website and documentations, making it more consistent and easier to use.

The idea was to make it more minimalistic, making it more readable and focused on the content.

## May 2025 - New CLI üê∫

We've released a CLI tool to simplify the process of copying and pasting the hooks into your project. Now you don't need to depend on the `shadcn` CLI to install hooks.

You can check it out in the [CLI](/docs/cli) section. Or can see it on [npmjs here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/guara-cli).
